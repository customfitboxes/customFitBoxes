  Advanced Printing Methods for High-Impact Packaging
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Digital Printing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Digital printing delivers impressive quality output for products with minorâ€”to medium-scale manufacturing demands, resulting in detailed and intensely colored finished prints.
</p>
  <h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Flexographic Printing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Customers who need large quantities of custom boxes should choose this economical printing approach. Businesses seeking mass production of custom packaging boxes featuring solid colors and simple designs should use this method.
</p>
  <h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Offset Printing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Large printing sets can rely on offset printing to produce precise and uniform results throughout their total quantity. This printing method ensures accurate color output and crisp line quality, which is essential for maintaining high design standards for custom-printed boxes.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Screen Printing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  The process's main application is showing off dynamic colors in custom boxes with logos while offering top visibility on both cardboard structures and solid boxes.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl primaryText fw_600 mt-4">
  Printing Color Models for Custom Boxes
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  CMYK Printing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  The CMYK printing model generates various colors by combining four printing inks: cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. The technique is extensively utilized for complete color output and achieves color mixing through subtraction.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  PMS (Pantone Matching System)
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  PMS is a standardized color-matching system that distributes unique codes to particular colors to achieve consistent reproduction between different media. Its primary application is branding, where it helps businesses maintain color consistency across multiple platforms.
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl fw_600 mt-3">
  Premium Finishing Techniques for Custom Boxes
</h2>
<p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Standout packaging plays an essential role for clients. The company maintains manufacturing and design capabilities, consistently creating innovative custom packages that build strong brand identities. Sustainability is achieved by implementing environmentally friendly materials and eco-friendly production methods while maintaining excellent performance. Premium finishes serve aesthetic and protective purposes, combining art with functionality so that each box performs efficiently based on form and function.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  UV Printing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  This method suits the production of logo-bearing custom boxes and custom print boxes when high-quality, durable finishes like gloss or matte surfaces are desired.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Embossing & Debossing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Embossing and debossing techniques acquire a luxurious appearance by adding raised or recessed designs. The texture adds depth, making your branding approachable through touch and more visually appealing.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Foil Stamping
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Custom boxes acquire an elegant and sophisticated appearance when you incorporate foil stamping as an enhancement. The foil stamping process creates metallic reflective finishes, making custom boxes, logos, and accents more noticeable.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Litho Lamination
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Premium quality printing through lamination offers luxury packaging, which helps preserve vibrant print designs, especially when you want to package high-end products.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Varnishing
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Varnishing applied to custom boxes improves both appearance and operational capabilities. This finishing process also creates glossy, matte, or satin finishes by applying protective coatings to printed surfaces.
    </p>
  <h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Glossy Lamination
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Gloss is the best choice if you want to see a shiny, reflective finish that enhances colors and details.
</p>
  <h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Soft-touch Lamination
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Soft touch lamination offers a velvety, tactile feel while maintaining a matte look.
</p>

  Spot UV Finish
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  A glossy coating is applied to specific areas for contrast and emphasis.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  AQ Coating
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  An aqueous coating for a smooth, satin-like finish that is eco-friendly.
</p>
<h3 className="text-lg fw_600 mt-3">
  Matte Lamination
</h3>
  <p className="text-sm mt-3">
  Provides a smooth, non-reflective finish with a soft touch.
